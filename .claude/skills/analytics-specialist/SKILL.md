- `memory-bank/agent-outputs/analytics-audit-output.md` - Previous analytics setup (if iterating)

## Your Process

### Phase 1: Strategic Foundation (10-15 minutes)

1. **Understand Channel Goals**
   - Review success criteria from marketing-context.md
   - Identify primary objectives (awareness, authority, monetization, community, etc.)
   - Determine time horizon (30-day, 90-day, 12-month goals)

2. **Baseline Current Performance**
   - Current subscriber count and growth rate
   - Average views per video
   - Engagement rate (likes + comments / views)
   - Watch time and retention patterns
   - Traffic sources (search, browse, suggested, external)

3. **Align with Brand & Content Strategy**
   - Which brand pillars should drive most engagement?
   - Which content types should drive most growth?
   - Which audience personas should we optimize for?
   - Which SEO keywords should we track ranking for?

### Phase 2: KPI Framework Design (15-20 minutes)

4. **Define North Star Metric**
   - The ONE metric that best indicates success
   - For new channels: Usually **Total Watch Time** (drives algorithm)
   - For growth channels: **Subscriber Growth Rate** or **Returning Viewer %**
   - For established: **Engagement Rate** or **Revenue per Video**

5. **Build KPI Hierarchy**
   - **Tier 1 (North Star)**: [Primary success metric]
   - **Tier 2 (Core Metrics)**: 3-5 metrics that directly drive North Star
     - Example: CTR, Avg. View Duration, Session Time, Subscriber Conversion
   - **Tier 3 (Supporting Metrics)**: 5-10 metrics that provide diagnostic insight
     - Example: Traffic sources, audience demographics, engagement types

6. **Set Benchmarks & Targets**
   - Current baseline for each KPI
   - 30-day improvement target
   - 90-day ambitious target
   - Industry benchmarks for German GenAI channels (research-based)

### Phase 3: Analytics Implementation (15-20 minutes)

8. **Custom Tracking Framework**
   - Create spreadsheet or tracking system for:
     - **Weekly snapshot**: Key metrics every Monday
     - **Per-video performance**: Video-by-video breakdown
     - **Cohort analysis**: How different video types perform
     - **Keyword rankings**: Track position for top 10 SEO keywords

9. **Alert & Trigger System**
   - When to celebrate (metrics exceeding targets)
   - When to investigate (metrics declining)
   - When to adjust strategy (consistent underperformance)

### Phase 4: Performance Analysis Framework (15-20 minutes)

10. **Video Performance Matrix**
    Create framework to categorize videos:
    - **Stars** (High views + High retention): Replicate these
    - **Potentials** (High views + Low retention): Improve retention tactics
    - **Loyal Fans** (Low views + High retention): Promote more, niche appeal
    - **Misses** (Low views + Low retention): Learn what didn't work

11. **Content Type Analysis**
    - Tutorials vs. Analysis vs. Reviews: Which performs best?
    - Beginner vs. Advanced: Which attracts more viewers?
    - Evergreen vs. Timely: Which has better longevity?
    - Video length: Optimal duration for your audience?

12. **Audience Insights**
    - Demographics: Are you reaching target personas?
    - Geography: DACH region % vs. other German speakers?

    - Subscription source: Which videos drive most subscriptions?

### Phase 5: Optimization Recommendations (10-15 minutes)

13. **Growth Levers Identification**
    - **Lever 1**: [e.g., Improve CTR from 4% to 6% = X more views]
    - **Lever 2**: [e.g., Increase retention from 45% to 55% = Y more watch time]
    - **Lever 3**: [e.g., Double upload frequency = Z more growth]
    - Quantify potential impact of each

14. **Experiment Roadmap**
    - A/B tests to run (titles, thumbnails, video formats)
    - Content experiments (new topics, new formats)
    - Publication experiments (different days/times, frequency changes)

### Phase 6: Documentation & Deliverables (15-20 minutes)

15. **Generate Analytics Documents**
    - Analytics Setup Guide
    - KPI Dashboard & Tracking Framework
    - Performance Analysis Playbook
    - Optimization Recommendations

16. **Create Reporting Cadence**
    - Daily: Quick glance at new video performance
