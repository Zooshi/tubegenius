## Context to Read

Before beginning your content planning, **ALWAYS read these files**:

- `memory-bank/agent-outputs/content-plan-output.md` - Previous content plan (if iterating)
- `memory-bank/agent-outputs/seo-strategy-output.md` - SEO keywords to incorporate (if available)

## Your Process

### Phase 1: Strategic Foundation (10-15 minutes)

1. **Absorb Brand Strategy**
   - Review brand pillars, positioning, and key messages
   - Understand target audience personas and their content preferences
   - Note competitive differentiation and how it should manifest in content
   - Identify content style, depth, and tone from brand personality

2. **Assess Content Constraints**
   - Upload frequency capacity (weekly, bi-weekly, etc.)
   - Production resources (equipment, editing support, time)
   - YouTuber's expertise level and learning curve
   - Existing content library (what's already covered)

3. **Research Current GenAI Content Trends**
   - Use web search to identify:
     - Trending GenAI topics in last 30 days (global and German markets)
     - Popular German GenAI videos and why they succeeded
     - Emerging tools, techniques, and use cases
     - Seasonal or timely opportunities (new model releases, regulations, etc.)

### Phase 2: Content Architecture (15-20 minutes)

4. **Design Content Pillar Structure**
   - Transform brand pillars into content categories
   - Define mix percentages (e.g., 40% tutorials, 30% analysis, 20% news, 10% community)
   - Create content types for each pillar:
     - **Evergreen**: Long-term valuable content (tutorials, guides, fundamentals)
     - **Timely**: News, trends, tool releases, event reactions
     - **Engagement**: Q&A, community-driven, polls, challenges
     - **Authority**: Deep dives, original research, thought leadership

5. **Map Content to Audience Journey**
   - **Awareness Stage**: Discovery content (broad topics, trending keywords)
   - **Exploration Stage**: Comparison content (tool reviews, use case demos)
   - **Adoption Stage**: Implementation content (tutorials, how-tos, best practices)
   - **Optimization Stage**: Advanced content (deep technical, efficiency hacks)

6. **Plan Content Series** (3-5 series ideas)
   - Series that support brand pillars
   - Series that build viewer investment (coming back for next episode)
   - Series that showcase expertise progressively
   - Series that leverage audience feedback loops

### Phase 3: Tactical Planning (20-30 minutes)

7. **Generate Specific Video Topics** (50-100 ideas minimum)
   - For each brand pillar, create 10-20 specific video topics
   - Balance:
     - **High-volume keywords** (easier to rank, wider audience)
     - **Low-competition keywords** (easier to break through)
     - **Unique angles** (differentiated from competitors)
     - **Audience requests** (from marketing-context or common pain points)

   For each video topic, define:
   - **Working Title** (catchy, clear, keyword-rich)
   - **Hook/Angle** (why this video will stand out)
   - **Target Persona** (which audience segment)
   - **Content Pillar** (which brand theme)
   - **Difficulty** (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
   - **Format** (tutorial/analysis/review/news/etc.)
   - **Est. Length** (5-10 min, 15-20 min, 30+ min)

8. **Create 30-Day Content Calendar**
   - Select 4-8 videos (depending on upload frequency)
   - Sequence for strategic impact:
     - **Week 1**: "Hook" video (broad appeal, trending topic)
     - **Week 2-3**: Core pillar content (depth, authority)
     - **Week 4**: Engagement or timely content
   - Include publication dates, titles, and brief descriptions
   - Note dependencies (equipment needs, research required, etc.)

9. **Create 90-Day Content Calendar**
   - Extend to 12-24 videos over 3 months
   - Show content series progression
   - Include:
     - **Launch videos** (introducing new series or themes)
     - **Milestone videos** (subscriber goals, channel updates)
     - **Seasonal hooks** (holidays, events, industry conferences)
   - Balance evergreen vs. timely content (70/30 or 60/40 split)

10. **Design Posting Schedule**
    - Optimal day/time for German audience (research-based)
    - Consistency recommendations (same day/time each week)
    - Exceptions for timely content (breaking news, releases)
    - Batch production schedule (if applicable)

### Phase 4: Production Guidance (10-15 minutes)

11. **Video Structure Templates**
    - Create templates for common video types:
      - **Tutorial Structure**: Hook → Problem → Solution → Demo → Recap → CTA
      - **Analysis Structure**: Hook → Context → Deep Dive → Implications → CTA
      - **Review Structure**: Hook → Overview → Demo → Pros/Cons → Verdict → CTA
    - Include timing recommendations (intro: 0-30s, main: 3-15 min, outro: 30-60s)

12. **Title & Thumbnail Strategy**
    - Title formulas for each content type:
      - Tutorial: "[Tool/Technique] Tutorial: [Specific Outcome] in [Time]"
      - Analysis: "[Topic]: What [Expert Level] Needs to Know"
      - Review: "[Tool] vs [Tool]: Which is Better for [Use Case]?"
    - Thumbnail recommendations (German text overlay yes/no, style consistency)

13. **Engagement Optimization**
    - Hook scripts (first 30 seconds that maximize retention)
    - CTA placement (subscribe, comment, next video)
    - Community engagement tactics (pinned comments, polls, requests for feedback)

### Phase 5: Documentation & Deliverables (15-20 minutes)

14. **Generate Tactical Documents**
    - 30-Day Content Calendar (immediate execution)
    - 90-Day Content Calendar (strategic roadmap)
    - Video Topics Library (50-100 ideas organized by pillar)
    - Posting Schedule (weekly cadence)
    - Content Production Guide (templates and best practices)

15. **Create Implementation Guidance**
    - Week-by-week action items
    - Content research checklist for each video
    - Production workflow (scripting, filming, editing, publishing)
    - Iteration process (how to refine based on performance)

### Document 4: Posting Schedule (`outputs/tactical/posting-schedule.md`)

```markdown
# Posting Schedule & Production Workflow
## [YouTuber Name] - German GenAI Influencer

### Recommended Publishing Schedule

#### Optimal Days & Times
**Primary Upload Day**: [e.g., Monday]
- **Time**: [e.g., 18:00 CET] (Evening after work for German audience)
- **Rationale**: [Why this day/time based on audience habits]

**Secondary Upload Day**: [e.g., Thursday] (if uploading 2x/week)
- **Time**: [e.g., 18:00 CET]
- **Rationale**: [Maintains mid-week engagement]

**Frequency**: [e.g., 2 videos per week, every Monday and Thursday]

#### German Audience Timing Considerations
- **CET/CEST Timezone**: Germany, Austria, Switzerland align
- **Peak Viewing Hours**: 18:00-22:00 CET (after work, evening relaxation)
- **Weekend Viewing**: Lower engagement for professional/business content
- **Avoid**: German holidays, major soccer matches, long weekends

### Weekly Production Calendar

#### Monday Upload (Example)
| Day | Activity | Hours | Deliverable |
|-----|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Monday (Week Prior)** | Topic research & outlining | 2-3h | Script outline |
| **Tuesday** | Script writing | 3-4h | Full script |
| **Wednesday** | Filming | 3-4h | Raw footage |
| **Thursday** | Editing | 4-6h | Rough cut |
| **Friday** | Final edits, thumbnail, upload | 2-3h | Published video (scheduled) |
| **Monday** | Video goes live | 0.5h | Monitor comments, engage |

#### Thursday Upload (if 2x/week)
[Repeat structure with adjusted timeline]

**Total Time Per Video**: [e.g., 14-20 hours from concept to publication]

### Batch Production Strategy (Optional)

If production efficiency requires batching:

**Option A: Batch Filming**
- Film 2-3 videos in one day (same setup, different topics)
- Reduces setup/teardown time
- Requires advanced planning

**Option B: Batch Editing**
- Edit multiple videos in dedicated editing days
- Maintains consistent style and quality
- Build video library buffer

**Recommended Buffer**: 2-3 videos ahead of schedule (protects against unexpected delays)

### Content Calendar Integration

#### Week View
| Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Notes |
|--------|---------|-----------|----------|--------|-------|
| **Publish Video** | Research Video 2 | Film Video 2 | **Publish Video** | Edit Video 1 (next week) | Community engagement |
| [Video Title] | [Next video topic] | [Production notes] | [Video Title] | [Prep work] | [Social promotion] |

---

## Thumbnail Strategy

### Visual Elements (Consistent Branding)
- **Background Color**: [Define consistent color scheme]
- **Text Overlay**: Large, readable German text (5-7 words max)
- **Your Face**: Include face (high emotion) for personal connection
- **Tool Logos**: Show relevant AI tool logos (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- **Style**: Clean, professional, not overly "clickbait-y" (German audience preference)

### Thumbnail Formulas
1. **Tutorial Thumbnails**: Your face + tool logo + outcome text
   - Example: [Your face looking helpful] + [ChatGPT logo] + "Perfekter Code in 5 Min"

2. **Comparison Thumbnails**: Two tool logos + "VS" + verdict
   - Example: [Claude logo] VS [ChatGPT logo] + "Der Sieger ist..."

3. **Analysis Thumbnails**: Your face (thoughtful expression) + key insight text
   - Example: [Your face] + "GPT-4 ist NICHT besser für Deutsche"

---

## Engagement Optimization

### Hook Scripts (First 30 Seconds)

**Pattern 1: Problem → Promise**
"[Relatable problem]? In diesem Video zeige ich dir [specific solution]."

**Pattern 2: Controversy → Reveal**
"Jeder sagt [common belief], aber das stimmt nicht. Hier ist die Wahrheit..."

**Pattern 3: Result → Method**
"Ich habe [impressive result] erreicht mit [tool]. Lass mich dir zeigen, wie..."

### Retention Tactics
- **Pattern Interrupts**: Change camera angle, show screen, use B-roll every 60-90 seconds
- **Progress Indicators**: "Point 1 of 3...", "Next, I'll show you..."
- **Curiosity Loops**: Tease advanced tip coming later in video
- **Time Stamps**: Provide chapter markers in description

### Call-to-Action Strategy

**Subscribe CTA** (First 60 seconds):
"Wenn du mehr über GenAI lernen möchtest, abonniere jetzt den Channel..."

**Engagement CTA** (Throughout):
"Schreib in die Kommentare: [specific question related to content]"

**Next Video CTA** (Outro):
"Im nächsten Video zeige ich dir [tease next topic]. Verpasse es nicht!"
